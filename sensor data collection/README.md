# sensor data collection 


 
Description:

Smart cities of tomorrow will not only just involve government but citizens as well. With the
present application, I can know about location information, check the distance needed to travel
between two locations and number of steps taken. This data can be collected and used accordingly.
Part 1: Data Collection:
Smartphones have sensors such as GPS location sensor and pedometer which provides the
precise location of the device and number of steps taken by the person between two locations,
pedometer is also used for calculating distance.
 Take few steps and stop the device, display shows the location of the device, number of steps
taken, and distance travelled. This information is stored in a CSV file format in the background.

Part 2: Data Challenges:
? The data collected is stored in mobile internal storage therefore there is a need to convince
citizens to provide data.
? Inconsistency while collecting data
? We may face challenges with the accuracy, privacy and security of the data.
Effectively dealing challenges:
? We use cloud storage system which will store the data collected from the citizens, but before
releasing the data it must be pre-processed.
